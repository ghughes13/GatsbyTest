In our discovery consultation with TriDigital they informed us on how we can improve our marketing results by revamping our marketing materials for mobile device compatibility and include videos in all of our literature. That approach sounded good to us so we contracted with TriDigital to head up the design and development of online digital playbooks for a few of the products and service we offer.  \n \n We began sending out email campaigns, which had call to actions that lead our prospects to view the online digital playbooks. The results were surprising and far better than we expected. Our conversion rates increased significantly due to the leads generated from mobile device users. We are very pleased with their service. They have a great design team, excellent process, and a fantastic marketing solution. We recommend their service to anyone in the channel looking to improve their marketing efforts.”",
