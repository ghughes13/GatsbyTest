          <h4>1. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
          <p>
            In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we
            collect two types of information about our users: Personally
            Identifiable Information and Non‑Personally Identifiable
            Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is
            to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience
            while using our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that
            lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in the
            activities contemplated by the Site Terms of service, including
            registering for membership, ordering service, downloading a video,
            or sending us feedback, we will ask you to provide certain
            information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online
            form. It is completely optional for you to elect to engage in these
            activities; however, we may ask that you provide us personal
            information, including your first and last name, mailing address
            (including zip code), E-mail address, employer, job title and
            department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal
            identifying information. When ordering services or videos on the
            site, you will be asked to provide a credit card number, credit card
            type, name as it appears on the card, security code for the card,
            expiration date, billing address, email address, company name and
            phone number. Chase Bank acts as our merchant and 1 Shopping Cart is
            used as our online payment system. Depending upon the activity, some
            of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory
            and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with
            respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in
            that activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Non‑Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information
            that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather
            certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site
            in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a
            personal and an aggregated basis. This information includes the Web
            site’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that you just came from,
            which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your
            Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. A URL is the global address of
            documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address
            is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control
            Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the World
            Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route
            information based on the IP address of the destination. In other
            words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to
            your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers
            to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses
            in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
          </p>
          <h4>2. COLLECTION METHODS AND USE OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p className="borwn-text">
            In compliance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
            (COPPA), our services are not directed to users under 18 years of
            age unless accessed under the careful supervision and consent of a
            parent or legal guardian. Any use by someone under this age is
            strictly prohibited and will be terminated immediately upon
            discovery. Further, any personally identifiable information provided
            by someone under 13 or that identifies someone under this age, will
            be deleted immediately upon discovery if in violation of this
            restriction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you
            unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain
            Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register for
            our services and register your E-mail address with us; (b) enter
            sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners; (c)
            sign up for special offers from selected third parties; (d) send
            E-mail messages, submit forms or transmit other information by
            telephone or letter; or (e) submit your credit card or other payment
            information when ordering and purchasing products and services on
            our site. We may also collect information from you at other points
            on our site that state that such information is being collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we also collect, or our third party ad server and/or
            content server may collect, certain Non‑Personally Identifiable
            Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of
            store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP
            address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to
            administer our site and to gather demographic information. Our third
            party ad servers will also provide us with summary, but not
            individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented
            and clicked upon at our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to
            provide our services to you, as required by your membership and
            order status with you. We will also use Personally Identifiable
            Information to enhance the operation of our site, fill orders,
            improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze
            site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize
            our site’s content, layout, and services. We will, as necessary, use
            Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you
            and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We will, as
            necessary, also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve
            disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you,
            including our Site Terms of service, Sales Terms and Conditions, and
            this Private Policy.
          </p>
          <h4>3. RELEASE OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable
            Information to others. We do provide some of our services through
            contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers,
            partners and other third parties. We and our service partners use
            your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our sites and to
            deliver their services. For example, we must release your credit
            card information to the card‑issuing bank to confirm payment for
            products and services purchased on this site; release your address
            information to the delivery service to deliver products that you
            ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us
            provide customer service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will notify you during any transaction that we are using a third
            party service provider by displaying a HTTPS (secure URL) and via
            the company watermark and company name on the foot of the page and
            you agree to review the third party service provider’s privacy
            policies and terms of service for continuing your transaction on
            this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial
            authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the
            appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally
            Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or
            to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully
            cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use
            our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report
            to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith
            believe to be unlawful.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using our site, you also give your consent for us to provide
            Non‑Personally Identifiable Information about our customers’ sales,
            traffic patterns, and related site information to third party
            advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally
            Identifiable Information.
          </p>
          <h4>4. UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the
            Personally Identifiable Information that you have provided to us.
            You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information in
            your account online at any time by signing on to your account. You
            may also access and correct your personal information and privacy
            preferences by writing us at info@TRIdigitalMarketing.com.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please include your name, address, E-mail address and the specific
            privacy preferences or Personally Identifiable Information you would
            like us to change when you contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable
            Information if it changes. For purpose of law enforcement, you may
            ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed;
            however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot
            delete information associated with past transactions on this site.
            In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your
            information without some residual information because of backups.
          </p>
          <h4>5. USER CHOICES ON COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We may, from time to time, send you E-mail regarding our products
            and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that
            you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and
            our partners, we may occasionally send you direct mail about
            products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. Only
            TRIdigital (or agents working on behalf of TRIdigital and under
            confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings and
            only if you indicated that you do not object to these offers. If you
            do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give
            us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily edit
            your account information to no longer receive such offers and
            mailings, or on the home page of our site and every interior page as
            well as the shopping cart.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below.
            By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept
            all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all
            cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our site
            may not work properly in your case.
          </p>
          <h4>6. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            At our site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable
            Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards.
            The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable
            Information associated with our user is of utmost concern to us.
            Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several
            ways. Access by you to your Personally Identifiable Information is
            available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.
            This password is encrypted and subject only to your use. We
            recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone and you
            will never be required to divulge your password to any TRIdigital
            agent or employee. In addition, your Personally Identifiable
            Information resides on a secure server that only selected TRIdigital
            personnel and contractors have access to via password. We encrypt
            your Personally Identifiable Information and thereby prevent
            unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is
            transmitted to us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personal information that you provide that is not Personally
            Identifiable Information also resides on a secure server and is only
            accessible via password.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and
            order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking,
            processing agents and distribution institutions. They receive the
            information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other
            payment information and to process and ship your order. No other
            information is transmitted that is not absolutely necessary to this
            transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any
            wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
            while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information,
            you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations
            of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security,
            integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged
            between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c)
            any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
            transit by a third party.
          </p>
          <h4>7. COOKIES</h4>
          <p>
            When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in
            order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is
            a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer’s
            hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved
            to identify you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user
            identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your
            first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your
            use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us
            to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our
            cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not
            work properly in that case.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner
            advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they will
            place a separate cookie on your computer. We will not provide any
            third‑party ad server with any of your Personally Identifiable
            Information or information about your purchases. We and our third
            party ad server will collect and use Non‑Personally Identifiable
            Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the
            server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code
            associated with your server and whether you responded to a
            particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our
            site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any
            Personally Identifiable Information to them.
          </p>
          <h4>8. PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTY SITES</h4>
          <p>
            Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document
            only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from
            you. Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy
            policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please
            consult each site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
            policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other
            companies which place advertising on our site may collect
            information about you when you view or click on their advertising
            through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of
            information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you
            have any questions about their use of the information that they
            collect.
          </p>
          <h4>9. MISCELLANEOUS PRIVACY ISSUES</h4>
          <p>
            You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable
            Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, E-mail
            address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on
            this site, that information, along with any information disclosed in
            your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and
            may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such
            activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to
            such information. The code of conduct for such forums is discussed
            in our Site Terms of service. Any submissions to chat rooms or other
            public areas on this site are accepted with the understanding that
            they are accessible to all third parties. If you do not want your
            comments to be viewed by third parties, you are advised not to make
            any submissions. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for
            maintaining the secrecy of your password and/or account information.
            Please be careful and responsible whenever you’re online.
