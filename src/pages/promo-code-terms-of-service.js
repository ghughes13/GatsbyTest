          <h2>Warmup Policies</h2>
          <h3>Choosing of style and of solutions.</h3>
          <span>
            A client may complete the Warmup questionnaire and select what
            solutions they would like to market and the style of their assets
            from the options TRIdigital provides. The client will have two weeks
            from the date of signing Terms of Services to make their choice. If
            the client does not choose within two weeks, TRIdigital will make
            the selections for the client. If the client misses the two-week
            window, the client may make the selection of style and solutions
            afterward and will be applied to future deliverables. However, the
            change will not take place on any previously delivered items or
            those that are currently in production.
          </span>
          <h3>Go live timeline</h3>
          <span>
            TRIdigital will go live two weeks from the date the client has
            provided all the information and answered all the questions needed
            to begin the creation of deliverables within the service.
          </span>
          <h3>Email Marketing </h3>
          <span>
            TRIdigital must receive a list in order to market. If no list is
            received, TRIdigital will build out all assets but will not be able
            to send them out. If this occurs, the warm lead guarantee is void.
            However, deliverables will still be created for the length of the
            agreement.
          </span>
          <h3>Edits</h3>
          <span>
            The Warmup is a templated service built to generate leads by
            utilizing content that TRIdigital has approved in order to meet or
            exceed the warm lead guarantee. No edits, outside of the ones listed
            below, can be made to the content or design of these items. If edits
            are made, TRIdigital can void the warm lead guarantee.The following
            are edits the client can make with no penalty:
